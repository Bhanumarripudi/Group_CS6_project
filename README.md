``Surface EMG Based Hand Gesture Signal Classification Using CNN for Control Of Software Robot​.``

``Objective:`` 

* To develop a hand gesture recognition model using surface EMG signals to control a software designed robot.​

* Hand gestures through surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, which are then converted into commands for the control of robots. 

``Main Goals :``​

1.Develop a Robot Gesture Classification System:​

* Capture and process Surface EMG signals to classify hand gestures with high accuracy.​

* Implement signal processing techniques to filter noise and extract meaningful features from EMG data.​

2.Control a Software Robot Using Gestures:​

* Translate classified gestures into robot movements (e.g., Forward, Backward, Left, Right).​

* Ensure real-time and reliable control of the robot via Wi-Fi communication
