``Surface EMG Based Hand Gesture Signal Classification Using CNN for Control Of Software Robot​.``

``Objective:`` 

To develop a hand gesture recognition model using surface  EMG signals to control a software designed robot.

``Main Goals :``​

1) Design an accurate hand gesture recognition model using automatic feature extraction and classification technique like  CNN with attention mechanism.​
2) Develop a software robot whose moment will be controlled using developed hand gesture recognition model.​

``Additional Goals:``​
1) To create a dataset using surface EMG sensor.​

2) Analysis of hand gesture model performance with the proposed method. ​
