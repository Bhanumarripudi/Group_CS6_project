## üéØ **System Design**

### üî• **1. System Architecture**
The project is designed using a **modular architecture** consisting of the following key components:  

- **Transmitter Module:**  
  - Captures EMG signals using **EMG sensors** placed on the forearm.  
  - Detects hand orientation using the **MPU6050 sensor**.  
  - Processes and transmits gesture data wirelessly via **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module**.  

- **Receiver Module:**  
  - Receives gesture data through **Wi-Fi communication**.  
  - Controls the robot's movements by sending signals to the **motor driver**.  
  - Executes corresponding robot actions (e.g., forward, backward, left, right).  

- **Signal Processing and Classification:**  
  - Applies **band-pass and notch filters** to remove noise from EMG signals.  
  - Uses a **CNN model** to classify gestures with **>92% accuracy**.  
  - Sends classified gesture commands to the robot.
